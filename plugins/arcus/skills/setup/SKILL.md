name: setup
description: Use when a developer wants to start using Arcus in a repo, or before authoring or pushing Arcus tests and something may be missing — checks the arcus CLI is installed, the user is signed in, and the repo has an Arcus project with the right platforms. Reports what is ready and what is not, and stops with the exact next step. Changes only local files, and only after the user agrees.

# Setup: is this repo ready for Arcus?

Arcus tests are `.sigma` files in a repo, checked and sent by the `arcus` CLI. Before anything is written or pushed,
three things must be true: the CLI is installed, the user is signed in, and the repo is bound to an Arcus project.
This skill checks them in that order, cheapest first, and stops at the first one that is not true.

You never handle credentials. You never sign the user in. You never change anything in Arcus: setup only reads from
Arcus, and writes only to the repo, and only after the user says yes.

## 1. The CLI is installed

Run `arcus --version`.

- **Not found.** Stop. Say the `arcus` CLI is not installed and give the one command: `npm i -g @testsigma/arcus-cli`.
  It needs Node 22 or newer. Do not install it for them.
- **Found.** Prove it is the right program and a recent one by running `arcus docs --topic project-layout --json`. This
  needs no project, so it works anywhere. The output must be JSON with `id` and `markdown`. If the command fails or
  the output has another shape, the CLI is too old, or it is another program named `arcus`. Stop, and tell the user to
  update it with the same npm command.

Note the version that `arcus --version` printed, for the report.

## 2. The user is signed in

Run `arcus auth status --json`.

- `loggedIn: true`: note `userEmail` and `region`, and go on.
- `loggedIn: false`: stop. Tell the user to sign in themselves, in a terminal (in Claude Code, `! arcus auth login`
  runs it in this session):

  ```
  arcus auth login --region us     # us, in or eu
  ```

  Ask which region their Arcus account is in. The default is `us`. Do not guess the region from their locale, their
  timezone or their email. A wrong region signs them in to the wrong deployment. Then wait: run step 2 again when they
  say they are done.

An exit code of `2` from any later `arcus` command also means the sign-in is missing or has expired. Send the user
back here.

## 3. The repo is bound to a project

Look for `arcus.json` in the current folder and in each folder above it. The CLI does the same.

### There is no `arcus.json`

The repo has no project yet. Ask which one:

1. Run `arcus project list`. It prints one project per line: the id, then the name. Show them and ask which project
   this repo is for. Do not choose for them, even if only one name looks right.
2. Ask where the tests go, only if this is the first project in the repo:
   - the default `tests/arcus`, which keeps Arcus tests inside this repo; or
   - `.`, which puts the project folders at the repo root, for a repo that holds only Arcus tests.

   This is one setting for the whole repo and the first `init` sets it.
3. Ask which platforms the tests must run on: `web`, `android`, `ios`, or a mix. The default is `web`. You may
   suggest one from the repo (an `android/` or `ios/` folder, a mobile framework in `package.json`), but the user
   decides. More platforms make `arcus check` stricter, because a test must compile on every one of them.
4. Say what `init` will do, and ask for a yes: it adds `arcus.json`, creates `<folder>/<project>/tests/` and
   `elements/`, and adds `.arcus/` to `.gitignore`. Then run:

   ```
   arcus init --project <id> [--dir <folder>] [--platforms <list>]
   ```

   If it refuses (the project is already there, an unknown id), show its message. It states the fix.

### There is an `arcus.json`

Read it. For each project, note its folder name, `projectId`, `region`, `platforms`, and the repo's `arcusDir`. Then:

- **Region.** The signed-in region (step 2) must equal each project's `region` that the user means to push to. If it
  does not, `arcus push` will refuse. Tell the user to run `arcus auth login --region <project region>`.
- **Several projects.** Every later command needs to know which one. Ask which project this session works on. Remember
  it, and pass `--project <name>` to `arcus docs`, `check`, `fmt` and `push` when you run them at the repo root. Without
  it, the CLI stops with `Which project?` (exit `3`). It can also tell from the folder the command runs in, or from
  paths that are all in one project.
- **Platforms.** Run `arcus project platforms [--project <name>]` and confirm they are where the tests must run. To
  change them, with the user's yes: `arcus project platforms add|remove <platform>`. A project always keeps at least
  one platform.
- **A new project in the same repo.** Only when the user asks: `arcus init --project <id>` again, without `--dir`.
  A different `--dir` is refused.

## 4. One more look at the repo

- `arcus.lock` is committed, not ignored. It records which file is which Arcus test. If `git check-ignore arcus.lock`
  prints it, tell the user to remove it from `.gitignore`.
- `.arcus/` is ignored. `init` adds the line. Nothing in it is shared.
- If the repo has a lock but no `.arcus/`, it is a fresh clone. Say that the first push adopts files that equal what
  Arcus holds, and refuses files that differ (there is no `pull` yet).

## 5. Report

End with a short status the user can read at a glance, then the next step. For example:

```
Ready.
  arcus CLI    installed (version from `arcus --version`)
  signed in    rachel@example.com, region us
  project      flight-and-hotel-booking-app (platforms: web), tests in tests/arcus/
Next: /arcus:author to write a test, or /arcus:push to send what is there.
```

When something is missing, say which line is not true, the one thing to do, and stop. Do not go on to authoring.

## What setup does not do

- It does not write tests (that is `/arcus:author`) or send them (`/arcus:push`).
- It does not run `arcus auth login`, `arcus push`, or anything that changes Arcus.
- It does not edit `arcus.json` by hand. Use the `arcus` commands, which keep the file valid.
- It does not look at the Arcus project's settings. If automation is off in Arcus, `arcus push` says so and stops.
