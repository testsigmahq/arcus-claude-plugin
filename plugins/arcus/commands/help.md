description: Show what the Arcus plugin does and how to use it
---

The Arcus plugin guides you through the developer side of the Arcus CLI and the QI workflow. QI is the quality service:
it keeps test cases as versions and a reviewer accepts them. Tests and elements are `.sigma` files. The `arcus`
command-line tool checks them offline, runs them on your machine, and sends them. The plugin sends nothing by itself.

A project works in one mode. **direct**: a push puts tests in Arcus at once. **qi**: a push sends tests to QI as
versions, and a reviewer accepts them. Elements go to Arcus in both modes.

## Skills

- `/arcus:setup` — Check the CLI, the sign-in, the project, its mode and platforms, and whether this machine can run
  web and Android tests. Stops with the one thing to do.
- `/arcus:context <issue>` — Qi mode. Read the issue, its cases and the policy from QI. Plan which tests to write.
- `/arcus:author [what to test]` — Write tests and elements as `.sigma` files. Loops check and format until clean.
- `/arcus:run [test]` — Run one test on web or Android (`--platform`, `--device`, `--app`). Says whether the test, the
  app or the setup is wrong. Nothing is sent.
- `/arcus:verify <issue>` — Qi mode. Run every case of an issue and report each one.
- `/arcus:push [files]` — Dry run first, a plan in words, a push after your yes. Explains every result and refusal.
- `/arcus:accept [files]` — Qi mode. Accept pushed versions into Arcus, after a policy check and your yes.
- `/arcus:sync` — Show where each file stands. Pull QI's changes. Detach or attach a file. Pipeline check.
- `/arcus:mode` — Show the project mode. Switch it with a dry run and your yes.

## Typical flow

1. `/arcus:setup` once per repo. Sign in yourself when it asks.
2. Qi mode: `/arcus:context CW-412` to see what QI expects. Direct mode: go to step 3.
3. `/arcus:author` — Claude writes the files and checks them.
4. `/arcus:run` — Claude runs the test and tells you what happened.
5. `/arcus:push` — read the plan, say yes, and commit `arcus.lock` with the tests.
6. Qi mode: `/arcus:sync` to see the review, `/arcus:verify` before a merge, `/arcus:accept` when the policy allows.

## Troubleshooting

- `arcus: command not found` — install the CLI (`/arcus:setup` gives the command).
- Exit code `2` — not signed in, or the region differs. Sign in yourself, then try again.
- Exit code `3` — wrong setup. Read the message and its `remediation`. A mode and lock mismatch: `/arcus:mode`.
- A push is refused — the plan says which file and why. `/arcus:push` explains each reason.
- `Cannot reach the …agent` — start the local test agent. Only web runs need it.
- `The Android tools (adb) were not found` — tell the CLI where the tools are: the `ARCUS_ANDROID_TOOLS_DIR` variable
  in your shell, or `arcus config set android.toolsDir <folder>`. `/arcus:setup` explains it.
- Several Android devices are ready — pass `--device <serial>`. `arcus device list` shows them.
- An Android step fails with only `Step failed` — Claude reads `results.ndjson` and the screenshot of the run. Ask it to.
- Not sure which commands the CLI has — `arcus help --json` prints all of them.
